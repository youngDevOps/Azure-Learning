Azure AZ-900 Learning Notes

Cloud Computing Advantages:

	- Reliability
	- Scalability (Horizontally/Vertically)
	- Elasticity 
	- Geo-distribution
	- Disaster Recovery

Cloud Services:
	- IaaS (Infrastructure As A Serice ) - Almost managing everything.
		- Advantages - No CapEx, Agility, Management, Consumption Based Model, Lower skills required, Cloud Benefits and flexibility
		- Disadvantage - Just like normal infrasturcture, not utilising cloud services
	- PaaS (Platform As A Service) - Managed hosting environment.
		- Advantages - No CapEx, Agility, Consumption Based Model, Lower skills required, Cloud Benefits and productivity.
		- Disadvantage - Platfrom Limitations
	- SaaS ( Software As A Service) - Cloud Provider pretty much manages everything.
		- Advantages - No CapEx, Agility, PAYG, Lower Skills required and flexibility.
		- Disadvantage - Software Limitations.

Serverless Computing - Developers can build applications quicker without managing underlying infrastructure.

Cloud Types:
	- Public Cloud - Services are offered over the public internet for all customers. Cloud Resources are managed by Cloud Provider e.g. Azure
	- Private Cloud - Computing Resources are used exclusively from one business or organisation. Can be located On-Prem or hosted by third party
	- Hybrid Cloud - Combines Public and Private Cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

Cloud Computing Consumption based model:
	- No upfront Costs
	- No need to purchse and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to the fullest.
	- The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
	- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

CapEx vs OpEx:
	- Capital Expenditure (CapEx) is the upfront spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up front expense over time. The up front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.
	- Operational Expenditure (OpEx) is spending money on services or products now, and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no upfront cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.

Azure

	- Azure free account -  Free access to popular Azure services for 12 months, credit for the first 30 days and 25 always free services.
	- Learn Sandbox - Creates a temporary subscription on yoru Azure account for the duration of the learn module to learn resources for free.

Azure Top down organisation hierarchy:
	- Resources - Azure Resources e.g. VMs
	- Resource Groups - Resources are combined into resource groups which act as a logical Container.
	- Subscriptions - A subscription group together user Accounts and the resources that have been created by those user Accounts
	  For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amounts of resources that you can create or use.
	  Organisations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams or projects.
	- Management Groups - Groups that help you manage access, policy and compliance for multiple subscriptions. 
		- All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.
	  	- Must Trust the same AD tenet.
		- 10,000 management groups in a single directory
		- A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit dosen't include the root level or the subscription.
		- Each management group and subscription can support only one parent
		- Each management group can have many children.
		- All Subscriptions and management groups are whithin a single hierarchy in each directory.
	

Azure Subscriptions:
	- Using Azure Requires a subscription
	- A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorised access to Azure Products and Services
	- Allows you to provision resources
	- An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure Services that links to an Azure account, which is an identity of in Azure AD or in a directory, Azure Trusts.
	- You can use Azure subscriptions to deifne boundries around Azure Products, services and resources.
	- Subscription boundries:
		- Billing - Determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. Can create multiple subscriptions for differant types of billing requirements.
					Azure generates sperate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can orgnaise and manage costs.
		- Access Control boundries - Azure Applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create seperate subscriptions to reflext differant orginisational structures.
		 							 Examples is that within a business, you have differant departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription policies.
									 This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions.
	- Reasons to create additional subscriptions include:
		- Environments - When Managing your resources you can choose to create a subscription to set up seperate environments for development, testing, security or to isolate data for compliance reasons.
		- Orginisational Structure - You can create subscriptions to reflect differant orginisational structures. E.g. you could limit a team to lower cost resources but give one team full range.
		  This design is particularly useful because resource access control occurs at the subscription level.
		- Billing - Create additional subscriptions for billing, to manage and track costs in e.g. dev or test.
		- Subscription limits - Subscriptions are bound to some hard limits e.g. the maximum number of Azure ExpressRoute circuits per subscription is 10. 
		- Customise Billing - E.g. for clients or departments.
