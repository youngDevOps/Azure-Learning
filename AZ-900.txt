Azure AZ-900 Learning Notes

Cloud Computing Advantages:

	- Reliability
	- Scalability (Horizontally/Vertically)
	- Elasticity 
	- Geo-distribution
	- Disaster Recovery

Cloud Services:
	- IaaS (Infrastructure As A Serice ) - Almost managing everything.
	- PaaS (Platform As A Service) - Managed hosting environment.
	- SaaS ( Software As A Service) - Cloud Provider pretty much manages everything.

Serverless Computing - Developers can build applications quicker without managing underlying infrastructure.

Cloud Types:
	- Public Cloud - Services are offered over the public internet for all customers. Cloud Resources are managed by Cloud Provider e.g. Azure
	- Private Cloud - Computing Resources are used exclusively from one business or organisation. Can be located On-Prem or hosted by third party
	- Hybrid Cloud - Combines Public and Private Cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

Azure 

Azure Benefits:
	- Ready for future - Continous Innovation from Microsoft.
	- Build in any language - Support for all languages and frameworks and commitment to open source.
	- Operate hybrid seamlessey - Ability to use hybrid easily
	- Security and Compliance - Strong secuirty and compliance

How does Azure work - Azure Potal/CLI -> API -> Orchestrator -> Network Switch -> Fabric Controller -> Server (Using Virtulisation and Hyper V).

Azure Portal:
	- Web Based Portal for Azure through GUI
	- Build, Manage and monitor Azure services
	- Create custom dashboards for resources
	- Configure accesibility options for optimal experiences
	- Designed for resiliency and continous availability

Azure Marketplace - Helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors and startups offering their solutions and services which are optimised for Azure.
